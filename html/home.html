	<p>A home page is a webpage that serves as the starting point of website. It is the default webpage that loads when you visit a web address that only contains a domain name. For example, visiting https://techterms.com will display the Tech Terms home page.

The home page is located in the root directory of a website. Most web server allow the home page to have one of several different filenames. Examples include index.html, index.htm, index.shtml, index.php, default.html, and home.html. The default filename of a website's home page can be customized on both Apache and IIS servers. Since the home page file is loaded automatically from the root directory, the home page URL does not need need to include the filename.</p>
