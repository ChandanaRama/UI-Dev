		<td><p>A resume objective (or a career objective) is a heading statement of your resume, in which you describe your professional goals in the job you're applying for. A resume objective is usually 2â€“3 sentences long and should be placed at the top of your resume. You should tailor it to the position on offer.
		The most effective objective is one that is tailored to the job you are applying for. It states what kind of career you are seeking, and what skills and experiences you have that make you ideal for that career. A resume objective might also include where you have been and where you want to go in your career.</p>
