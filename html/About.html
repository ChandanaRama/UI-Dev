	The “About Us” section is often the most overlooked aspect of a company’s website. Often all the focus is put on your services or products, as these are the pages which most often affect your search engine results. However, sometimes in the pursuit of SEO, we overlook the user’s experience. This commonly occurs on the “About Us” page because it is a more content heavy page of a website. Even if your “About Us” section isn’t stuffed with keywords, that doesn’t mean the information provided on this page isn’t useful. This page exists to answer questions visitors may have about who you are as a dealership and if they want to do business with you.  </p>
